# Simulated Autonomous Explorating using Object-Detector Technology

By [Christopher Patuzzo](http://chris.patuzzo.co.uk/)

The full project write up is located at Miscellaneous > Final Report.

### Source Code

The 'Source Code' directory contains all of the files required, to compile and run the simulation. Simply import the source files into a Visual Studio project and compile. The simulation is dependent upon the 'GLUT' and 'Boost' libraries, freely available from the links below:
http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/
http://www.boost.org/users/download/

### Test Configurations

The 'Test Configurations' directory contains the test configuration files, used by the simulation, explained in the Empirical Evaluation section of the report.

### Test Results

The 'Test Results' directory contains the results collected by running each of the test configuration files. The first column is the time at which the robot exited from the simulation, or 0 if it reached the end of its testing duration. The second and third columns contain the completeness and accuracy values respectively.

### Miscellaneous

The 'Miscellaneous' directory contains a copy of the report in PDF and Latex formats as well as all of the figures and freely available references used in the report.
